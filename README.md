# Pac-Man-Replica Web Game

A simple Pac-Man-inspired web game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features a playable Pac-Man character navigating through a maze while being chased by a ghost. The game includes basic collision detection, player movement controls, and a game-over condition when the ghost catches Pac-Man.

## Features

- **Pac-Man Movement:** Control Pac-Man using the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to navigate through the maze.
- **Ghost AI:** The ghost actively chases Pac-Man, attempting to catch him.
- **Maze Layout:** A maze-like structure with walls and passages that Pac-Man must navigate through.
- **Collision Detection:** Both Pac-Man and the ghost cannot pass through walls, and collision detection ensures accurate movement.
- **Game Over Condition:** The game ends when the ghost catches Pac-Man, displaying a "Game Over" alert.
